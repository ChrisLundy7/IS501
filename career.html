                        <h4>Experience:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I graduated from my undergrad with a degree in Business Management, with an emphasis in Finance. Since then I haven't done a lick 
                            of finance. I gratefully stumbled into supply chain and have been there ever since. I quickly moved into a Buyer role with 
                            Golden Valley Natural, a jerky manufacturer. I loved how this role allowed me to support a product from initial conception all the way 
                            through finished good production and distribution to customers. Within the company I got to work with marketing, R&D, sales, IT, 
                            and both the CFO and CEO.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along came Covid and my company downsized significantly, so I moved across the street to Melaleuca, a health and wellness company. There 
                            I had the opportunity to experience and assist with global distribution and order fulfillment operations. I then moved into a Supply Chain 
                            Analyst role where I was responsible for making the distribution plans for two categories of products - I was now directing the hands-on 
                            work that I had done at the distribution and fulfillment center. I worked with our production planners and buyers to align their schedules 
                            with my global distribution needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my MBA I've had the opportunity to intern with ExxonMobil on their MRO Procurement team. There I was tasked with implementing 
                            their MRO Transformation Project in Europe and Asia Pacific. This project focused on qualifying and filtering through over 8,000 
                            suppliers to try and identify those of greatest value. The goal was to reduce the number of suppliers used and consolidate spend 
                            so ExxonMobil could leverage their scale more effectively to get better pricing and reduce their MRO costs across the globe.

                        <h4>Anticipated Contributions to the Field:</h4> 
                        <p>
                            The greatest benefit that I will bring to this field is my dedication to improving lives - the lives of my coworkers, customers, and our families.
                            I care about people, and champion others whenever possible. I develop meaningful partnerships that are able to overcome difficult obstacles.
                            At the end of the day, I seek to improve quality of products, processes, and lives.
                        </p>
